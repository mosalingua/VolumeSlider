VolumeSlider
============

Updated o 20/03/2018 by uareurapid (cordova IOS 4.5.4) 
*Updated for Cordova 3.0* by orbitaloop

Installation
------------

PhoneGap / Cordova iOS plugin that allows you to add a native volume slider (MPVolumeView) to your app.

Add the plugin much like any other:
With cordova:
cordova plugin add https://github.com/mosalingua/VolumeSlider
or if you prefere, directly on the iOS project with plugman:
plugman install --platform ios --project . --plugin https://github.com/mosalingua/VolumeSlider

### Example
```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	var volumeSlider = window.plugins.volumeSlider;
	volumeSlider.createVolumeSlider(10,350,300,30); // origin x, origin y, width, height
	volumeSlider.showVolumeSlider();
}
```

... now since this is a native control added more or less on top of your webView, you might have to show and hide it if you navigate away from the _page_ you want the VolumeSlider on:

```javascript
volumeSlider.hideVolumeSlider();
```
